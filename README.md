# CreditRiskProject

The objective of this project is to model the expected default probability
and credit spread of a firm that is financing itself partly through debt
capital. In particular, I want to explore the impact of different
modelling assumptions to expected default probability and credit
spread, using a simulation-based approach. Please refer to the main pdf file
for the essay and related Python code snippets.
